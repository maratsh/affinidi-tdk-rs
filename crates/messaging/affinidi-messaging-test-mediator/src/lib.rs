//! Embedded mediator fixture for integration tests.
//!
//! Spins up a fully functional Affinidi messaging mediator on
//! `127.0.0.1:0` (ephemeral port), with a freshly-generated `did:peer`
//! identity, a random JWT signing key, and the caller's choice of
//! storage backend. Returns a [`TestMediatorHandle`] exposing the
//! bound URL, the mediator DID, the populated secrets resolver, and
//! a shutdown control.
//!
//! # Quick start
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use affinidi_messaging_test_mediator::TestMediator;
//!
//! #[tokio::test]
//! async fn end_to_end_round_trip() {
//!     let mediator = TestMediator::spawn()
//!         .await
//!         .expect("test mediator spawn");
//!
//!     let endpoint = mediator.endpoint();
//!     let did = mediator.did();
//!     // ... use SDK against `endpoint` and `did` ...
//!
//!     mediator.shutdown();
//!     mediator.join().await.unwrap();
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Tests that authenticate a non-admin client over WebSocket must
//! pre-register the client's DID — the WS handler refuses upgrades
//! without the LOCAL ACL bit, and the fixture's default
//! `global_acl_default` doesn't grant it on first auth:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let mediator = TestMediator::builder()
//!     .local_did(client_did.clone())
//!     .spawn()
//!     .await
//!     .expect("spawn");
//! ```
//!
//! See [`TestMediatorBuilder::local_did`] / [`TestMediatorBuilder::local_dids`].
//!
//! # Storage backends
//!
//! The fixture defaults to `MemoryStore` — fastest, no I/O, automatic
//! cleanup. Pass a custom store via [`TestMediatorBuilder::store`] for
//! tests that need different semantics:
//!
//! - **Fjall** (on-disk LSM) — compile with the `fjall-backend` feature
//!   and call [`TestMediatorBuilder::fjall_backend`]. The fixture
//!   manages a temp directory whose lifetime is tied to the handle, so
//!   no partition files leak.
//! - **Redis** — supply an `Arc<RedisStore>` via `store(...)`. Useful
//!   for tests that exercise multi-mediator coordination, but requires
//!   a reachable Redis instance.
//!
//! [`MediatorStore`]: affinidi_messaging_mediator_common::store::MediatorStore
//!
//! # DID resolution
//!
//! The mediator's DID is `did:peer:2.*` — fully self-describing. Test
//! clients using `affinidi-did-resolver-cache-sdk` resolve it locally
//! via the built-in `PeerResolver`; no DNS or network round trip is
//! required. The fixture's secrets resolver is pre-populated with the
//! mediator's signing and key-agreement secrets so the SDK can encrypt
//! to the mediator without any setup beyond cloning the resolver:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let resolver = mediator.secrets_resolver();
//! // hand `resolver` to your SDK setup ...
//! ```
